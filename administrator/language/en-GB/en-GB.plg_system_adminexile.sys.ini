PLG_SYS_ADMINEXILE_XML_DESC="<p>AdminExile is a security measure for your administration backend.  It's easy to determine that your site is running Joomla, because attackers can just add "/administrator" to your URL and they're presented with a login panel.  This plugin adds a layer of security to your administrator backend by requiring a URL variable as an initial access key.</p><p>This plugin is meant to replace the formerly free JSecure Authentication plugin.</p><p>Setup is easy:<ol><li>Use the text field to the right to select your administrator access key.  Example:<strong>adminexile</strong></li><li>Upon saving, you will be redirected to your homepage (do not fear, this is normal!)</li><li>Type in your administrator url adding your access key to the end &quot;<strong>?adminexile</strong>&quot;</li></ol><strong>NEW in version 1.1: Backend failure destination URL and Frontend user group restrictions!</strong>"
