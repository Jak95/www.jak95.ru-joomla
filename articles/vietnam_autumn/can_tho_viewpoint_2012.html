      Расположенное в 5 км от центра Кантхо, 130-летнее здание поистине впечатляет своей красотой. Биньтхуй насыщен оригинальными особенностями дельты.
      Строительство здания (8000 кв. м) началось в 1870 году Ба Нгиа, известным в то время ремесленником, способным построить здание из 5 отсеков, идеально
      подходящим друг к другу.<br>

      <b>Что можно посмотреть еще:</b><br>
      Located in Binh Thuy Ward, about five kilometers from the center of Can Tho, the site is not as famous as other sites in the city such as Binh Thuy Old
      House, Cai Rang Floating Market, Ninh Kieu Wharf or Ong Pagoda.<br>
      However, the communal house, which has existed for over two centuries, will bring another side of Can Tho’s history with its fine architecture and
      antiques.<br>
      Built in the 19th century, the Communal House was named Bon Canh Thanh Hoang on November 9th 1893 by King Tu Duc.<br>
      Later the Communal House was dedicated to national heroes including Dinh Cong Trang, Nguyen Trung Truc, Bui Huu Nghia and Vo Huy Tap. It was completely
      renovated in 1910.<br>
      If you are an architecture enthusiast, you will recognize that the communal house’s architecture is different from communal houses in the north. The
      front and the back buildings are square, and its side has six rows of columns, and all the columns’ bases are extra-wide, making these buildings more
      stable.<br>
      The roofs of the two front buildings were built overlapping each other. The main temple at the rear has three roofs. The top of the roof is covered with
      statues of people, lions and fish.<br>
      In the front of the building, there are cement columns. Inside the ancestor-worshipping house, there are altars dedicated to worship the animal gods.<br>
      It is considered a valuable monument of art and architectural style in the newly-expanded south western area. Although it was built at the beginning of
      the 20th century, its architecture has many traditional characteristics with carved and engraved wooden boards.<br>
      Bas-reliefs, lacquered boards and paralleled sentences or royal costumes and old paintings is an interesting area for art lovers.<br>
      Another impressive thing is the attendance of ong tu (the guard) of the house. He is very old with white hair and slowcoach gait. He will accompany you
      around the house and show you where to take the best photographs.<br>
      Some giant trees in the spacious yard shading the house make it more ancient and peaceful.<br>
      The house is also a venue for traditional ceremonies and festivals.

      <b>И еще подробнее о доме:</b><br>
      The owner of this ancient house is respected Mr. Duong Minh Hien, an old sentimental man, by chance, remaining in the 20th century. It is just thanks to
      its maintained ancientness that this house was chosen as one of recording sites for the romantic film “Lover” of producer J. Annaud. The native homeland
      of the Duongs' family was originally in Nha Man, Dong Thap Province, but they moved to Binh Thuy, Cantho and installed themselves here more than 100
      years ago. They are so considered as “creators of heaven and earth” in this region. By the end of 19th century, this family became quite rich. At that
      time, the head of family, called by contemporary people as “Mr. Ba - council member”, decided to spend his money and efforts in building a house “for
      nothing” (?), only for showing antiquities. The construction was started in 1870 on an area of approximately 8,000m?. According to respected Mr. Duong,
      at that time, a master with the name of Ba Nghia - but people used to call him by master Lo Ban - lived in this region, who was able to make very nice
      houses.<br>
      It was noteworthy that he had a strange physiognomy. His height accounted only for one meter and some centimeters, while his backbone was so twisted that
      his silhouette looked like a “question mark”. Throughout the years, he remained half-naked wearing only black satin breeches and wound a red silk turban
      round his head. The master Lo Ban had two inseparable things: a marker and an axe. With this “treasure”, he completed an uncountable number of perfectly
      round ironwood pillars. The conditions that the council member Mr. Ba posed were quite serious – “You should make my house splendid much more than
      others', it is unquestionable; but the problem is to make it sure that after the house is finished, I should become richer”. The master Ba Nghia thought
      for a long while and said: “But, but, in my profession, if the customer makes his fortune, I'll immediately fall unlucky”. “No, no, don’t worry. I
      guarantee that I'll monthly provide you with 3 pecks of rice and some pieces of silver whenever you're alive”.<br>
      Nobody knew exactly how this story continued, but local people blabbed that the master Lo Ban certainly used amulet or talisman, because otherwise, the
      council member Mr. Ba couldn't become rich so fast. Letting aside these rumors, one must acknowledge that the master Ba Nghia was a top-ranking
      artisan-artist, when he was able, only with an axe, to construct a 5-compartment house with all close-fitting joints. It was said that the construction
      lasted for 20 years. In the house there is a coach set placed just before the altar. It is a souvenir of the respected Mr. Duong's grandfather. It is
      said that to make this set of ironwood chairs, a craftsman, native in southern provinces, had to carve dragon- and phoenix-shaped details as precise as
      in millimeters. One particularity is that while the chairs are so big and so heavy, their legs are as thin as children's wrist. Another craftsman named
      Dong Van Chiem, native in northern provinces, was charged of inlaying pearl vignettes. Nowadays, after more than hundred years, these vignettes are still
      brilliantly shining with their “five colors”. As other houses of landlords in the “region of six provinces” (Mekong Delta), the owner of this house also
      hired craftsmen to make a balustrade, connecting the ironwood pillars in front of the altar. In this case, however, the originality resides in the fact
      that the vignettes on this balustrade do not comprise any old Chinese classic references as others. Instead, all vignettes included here represent daily
      popular scenes of the common people: from crabs, chickens till ivory bamboo branch or clump of trees. Is it true that the craftsmen’s inspiration was to
      glorify the peaceful atmosphere at that time dominating rural areas in the southern provinces?<br>
      According to the respected Mr. Duong's stories, his grandfather was named Duong Chan Ky, whose souvenir is a portrayed picture, now solemnly hanging just
      in the middle room. An originality of the picture is that it was made in enameled terra-cotta with details as veritable as that of present photographs.
      It is said that such a technique of making pictures was known only in France and China since the end of the 18th century. However, the writing in Chinese
      on the picture confused me, whether the craftsmen from Ben Nghe knew this technique. If it is true, the issue needs to be more studied. The picture has
      experienced so many events; there was a time when it was buried into mud to avoid bombing, but did not suffer from any harm. This family still keeps
      numerous cups, bowls, plates; all of which have a noble origin. The oldest objects are a bowl from the Ming Dynasty in China with an age of 572 years and
      a big flower-vase with an age of nearly 533 years.<br></a>
